# Next Up.

It would be great to release a mobile version of app as well. The UI is already mobile ready. I would need some support for this due to strict limitations of Play Store and App Store. Hit me up.

I'm also noticing few problems regarding online gameplay experience. I will work on fixing those as soon as possible.

# Final Words

This project started back in 2021 when i was in my first year of college. I learned flutter through making a simple go game with Firebase.

In October 2024, after completing my college, I decided to learn .NET and again started working on this project. Since then I have rewritten the entire server in .NET. I chose to stick with flutter for the frontend.

I have learned a lot through my journey and i hope to contribute to the go community with this project.
